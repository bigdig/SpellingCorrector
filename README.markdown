## Description

A simple spell corrector in Objective-C for iOS or Mac OS. It is totally based on [How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) by Peter Norvig. 

It doesn't handle context, aka you can only submit one word to correct and you get an array of suggestions.

It does cache the results. All code uses ARC.
